## Description
This code will prepare and provide a completed character sheet with a randomly generated race, class, stats, and alignment. It will present the option of self inputting for each field, grouped by section for ease of use, and will randomly generate anything not pre-determined, outputting a complete file with the name of the character as the title. This will be an ideal tool for beginner players, short campaigns, or NPC creation, and can be used to create several characters quickly and keep them organized.
